#      currently in. To define this, put the Dex name and the region number in
#      an array, like the Kanto and Johto Dexes are. The National Dex isn't in
#      an array with a region number, therefore its area map is whichever region
#      the player is currently in.
# * Whether all forms of a given species will be immediately available to view
#      in the Jermodex so long as that species has been seen at all (true), or
#      whether each form needs to be seen specifically before that form appears
#      in the Jermodex (false).
# * An array of numbers, where each number is that of a Dex list (National Dex
#      is -1). All Dex lists included here have the species numbers in them
