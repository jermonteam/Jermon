# Jermon

Hi, and welcome to Jermon. If you're seeing this, either you've been given links to this by the development crew or you're quite lucky.

#### About
Jermon is a fangame built in the style of Pokemon game. However, custom assets, characters, and of course creatures named Jermon inhabit the world to make it a truly unique experience. All these creations are modeled after references, memes, and culture created by Twitch Streamer and Entertainer Jerma985.

#### Status
The game is currently in development, being created by a group of Jerma985 fans. Periodic releases are being pushed out for early development and testing. Further information to come as we get closer to releasing a public demo.
